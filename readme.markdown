Welcome to Lock Manager!
=========================

###Features:
* Assign Codes to Users.
* Be notified when a user uses their code.
* Delete codes after they are used*.
* Optionally Schedule Users so that they only have access during certain times, modes, or days of the week.
* Decide which notifications to receive in the event that the locks are too chatty.

\* Code is burned once per scheduled period.  If a new cycle starts, that code will be active once again.  If no schedule is created, the code will only work once.

###Planned:
* Actions after user enters codes, such as turning on/off appliances.
* Auto-unlock other locks after user enters codes.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
---------------------
It is possible that a user code deletion could fail.  Do not give door codes to people that you don't want access to your home or office, and watch notifications carefully.
