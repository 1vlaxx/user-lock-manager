Welcome to Lock Manager!
=========================

###Features:
* Assign Codes to Multiple Users.
* Manage Multiple Locks.
* Be notified when a user uses their code.
* Delete codes after they are used*.
* Optionally Schedule Users so that they only have access during certain times, modes, or days of the week.
* Decide which notifications to receive in the event that the locks are too chatty.
* When a code is entered, preform Hello Home Actions

\* Code is burned once per scheduled period.  If a new cycle starts, that code will be active once again.  If no schedule is created, the code will only work once.

##How to use:
1. Install the app via the SmartThings developer IDE.  Copy all code from the .groovy file on this repository.
  Having trouble with this step?  Use this [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6rG4mk164M&feature=youtu.be) by user Scott in Pollock on youtube.
1. Navigate to My Apps on your smart device.  Follow the prompts on your new app.
1. When complete, either press the app icon to activate the code, or allow the schedule to run.  Pressing the app button outside of the set schedule will still allow the user access!

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
---------------------
It is possible that a user code deletion could fail.  Do not give door codes to people that you don't want access to your home or office, and watch notifications carefully.
